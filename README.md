# LogisTech_DEVAN
LogisTech is a centralized warehouse orchestration system designed to efficiently store incoming inventory, manage truck loading, and ensure comprehensive tracking through a relational database.

The virtual environment , where I have performed the work is uploaded into the google drive fro your reference.

The google drive link : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LHpYXDK4Yo_n2Us0g9-jYnu-0UymljJx?usp=sharing

The output screenshots from the flask api ui is snapped and stored in the google drive : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U5uCxh87hV43D969MWjM3xeK1-R0N3up?usp=sharing


NOTE : In the above folder , where the output screenshots and recordings are stored. In which I have included the screen recording of the output according to the evaluation checkboxes

Checkbox 1 Implementation (Video File Name) : Has only the binary search part of the project implemented.

3 checkboxes implementation (Video File Name) : Has the binary search , queue implementation along with backtracking and also the fragile constraints of the containers to be loaded.

All 5 Checkboxex (Video File Name) : Has the entire 5 evaluation checkboxes been validated.

The All 5 Checkboxex (Video File Name) will be a screen recording of the Visual Studio code , as the SQL Implementaion and the Singleton pattern are implemented in the Local virtual environment using python language.

Checkbox 1 Implementation (Video File Name), 3 checkboxes implementation (Video File Name) : These two files has the implementaion in html view page for better understanding and representation.

App.py , the file contains the code for implementing this entire warehouse simulator in flask api.


Thank u and happy coding 🤗
